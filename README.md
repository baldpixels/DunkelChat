# MODULE 6 (Group) #

## Start Here... ##
* On ec2 instance, all Module 6 files can be found at ~/module_6
* Default Rooms: 'Lobby', 'We Like Sports'
* After logging in, all new users are dumped into the Lobby.
* If a user is kicked, they are returned to the lobby.

## Creative Portion: ##
* DunkelChat's style was creative, I'd argue.

## Sources ##
* I referenced [this socket.io example](https://github.com/socketio/socket.io/tree/master/examples/chat), but I believe I made the actual interface and socket interactions uniquely my own.
