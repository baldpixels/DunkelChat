# MODULE 6 (Group) #

## Start Here... ##
* After you've downloaded the repo, navigate to the 'chatroom-app' directory and start the server with 'node index.js'
* Default Rooms: 'Lobby' and 'We Like Sports'
* After logging in, all new users are dumped into the Lobby.
* If a user is kicked, they are returned to the lobby.
* On ec2 instance, all Module 6 files can be found at ~/module_6

## Creative Portion: ##
* A room's creator has the option to send a message to every user in the room via an alert pop-up.
* DunkelChat's layout and style was creative, I'd argue.

## Sources ##
* I referenced [this socket.io example](https://github.com/socketio/socket.io/tree/master/examples/chat), but I believe I made the actual interface and socket interactions uniquely my own.
